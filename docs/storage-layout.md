# Storage Layout

Reference for off-chain indexers that read PayStream **stream contract** ledger state directly.
Source of truth: `DataKey` in `contracts/stream/src/types.rs` and the accessors in
`contracts/stream/src/storage.rs`.

---

## Key encoding (XDR)

`DataKey` is a `#[contracttype]` enum, so each key is encoded as an `ScVal::Vec`:

- **Unit variant** (e.g. `Admin`) → `Vec[ Symbol("Admin") ]`
- **Tuple variant** (e.g. `Stream(u64)`) → `Vec[ Symbol("Stream"), <payload> ]`

`u64` payloads encode as `ScVal::U64`; `Address` payloads encode as `ScVal::Address`.

Example: the key for stream `7` is `Vec[ Symbol("Stream"), U64(7) ]`.

### `Stream` value

`Stream` is a `#[contracttype]` struct, encoded as an `ScVal::Map` keyed by field name
(`Symbol`), sorted alphabetically:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | `i128` | Total deposited amount |
| `employee` | `Address` | Recipient |
| `employer` | `Address` | Funder |
| `id` | `u64` | Stream ID |
| `last_withdraw_time` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp of the last withdrawal |
| `locked` | `bool` | Reentrancy guard (normally `false` between transactions) |
| `rate_per_second` | `i128` | Tokens streamed per second |
| `start_time` | `u64` | Ledger timestamp the stream started |
| `status` | `StreamStatus` | `Vec[Symbol("Active" \| "Paused" \| "Cancelled" \| "Exhausted")]` |
| `stop_time` | `u64` | Hard stop timestamp (`0` = no end) |
| `token` | `Address` | Token contract address |
| `withdrawn` | `i128` | Total already withdrawn |

## TTL thresholds

Persistent keys are extended on every read/write through `storage.rs` (except
`StreamEndedAt`, see table above). Temporary rate-limit keys live for 2 ledgers.

| Constant | Ledgers | Approx. time (5 s/ledger) |
|---|---|---|
| `TTL_THRESHOLD` | `6_307_200` | ~1 year |
| `TTL_EXTEND_TO` | `12_614_400` | ~2 years |

When a persistent entry's remaining TTL drops below `TTL_THRESHOLD`, it is extended to
`TTL_EXTEND_TO`. Streams that are never touched for longer than their remaining TTL are
archived and must be restored before they can be read on-chain; indexers should rely on
their own copy of historical data rather than live state for archived streams.

Instance keys share the TTL of the contract instance entry.

## Keys affected by contract upgrades

`upgrade` / `execute_upgrade` replace the WASM only; all storage is preserved.

- `Version` — written by `migrate` after an upgrade; indexers can use it to detect schema changes.
- `AdminNonce` — incremented by every admin call, including upgrades.
- `PendingUpgrade` — set by `propose_upgrade`, cleared by `execute_upgrade` / `cancel_upgrade`.
- `Stream`, `EmployerStreams`, `EmployeeStreams` — unchanged by upgrades. If a future version
  changes the `Stream` struct layout, `Version` will be bumped and the change noted in
  `CHANGELOG.md` and [upgrade-guide.md](upgrade-guide.md).
