# Admin Multisig Setup for Mainnet (SEC-01 / SEC-30)

**Issue:** #30, #268  
**Status:** Design  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Dependency:** SC-01 (LOW-02 fix — `initialize` guard) should be merged first

## Overview

The PayStream stream contract admin is currently a single keypair. If that key is compromised,
an attacker can:

- Pause the contract (blocking all withdrawals)
- Change the minimum deposit
- Upgrade the contract WASM to arbitrary code

For mainnet, the admin **must** be a multisig account with a **minimum 2-of-3 signer
configuration**. This document covers the recommended setup, two approaches (Stellar native
multisig and a deployed multisig contract), the onboarding checklist for transferring admin to
a multisig, the operations runbook for admin calls, and the steps to verify admin operations
work through multisig auth on testnet before mainnet deployment.

---

## Recommended Approach: Stellar Native Multisig

Stellar accounts natively support M-of-N threshold signing. This is the simplest approach and
requires no additional smart contracts.

### Setup

1. Create a dedicated admin Stellar account (do not reuse a hot wallet).

2. Add co-signers:

   ```bash
   # Add signer B with weight 1
   stellar account signer add \
     --account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
     --signer-key <SIGNER_B_PUBLIC_KEY> \
     --weight 1 \
     --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
     --network mainnet

   # Add signer C with weight 1
   stellar account signer add \
     --account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
     --signer-key <SIGNER_C_PUBLIC_KEY> \
     --weight 1 \
     --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
     --network mainnet
   ```

3. Set thresholds to require 2-of-3 for all operations:

   ```bash
   stellar account set-options \
     --account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
     --low-threshold 2 \
     --medium-threshold 2 \
     --high-threshold 2 \
     --master-weight 1 \
     --source <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> \
     --network mainnet
   ```

4. Verify the account configuration:

   ```bash
   stellar account show --account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT> --network mainnet
   ```

   Confirm that `thresholds` shows `low: 2, medium: 2, high: 2` and that three signers
   are listed each with weight `1`.

### Signing admin transactions

Soroban's `require_auth()` respects Stellar account thresholds. To submit an admin operation
(e.g., `pause_contract`), collect signatures from 2 of the 3 signers before submitting:

```bash
# Build the transaction (signer A)
stellar contract invoke --id <STREAM_ID> --source <SIGNER_A_KEY> --network mainnet \
  --build-only \
  -- pause_contract --nonce 0 > tx.xdr

# Sign with signer B
stellar tx sign --xdr "$(cat tx.xdr)" --source <SIGNER_B_KEY> --network mainnet >> tx.xdr

# Submit (now has 2 signatures, meeting the threshold)
stellar tx submit --xdr "$(cat tx.xdr)" --network mainnet
```

---

## Alternative Approach: Deployed Multisig Contract

For teams that prefer a programmable multisig (e.g., time-locked proposals, on-chain voting),
deploy a Soroban multisig contract and set its address as the PayStream admin.

Recommended reference implementation: [stellar-multisig](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples)

Set the multisig contract address as the admin during `initialize`:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <STREAM_ID> --source <DEPLOYER_KEY> --network mainnet \
  -- initialize --admin <MULTISIG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

---

## Mainnet Onboarding Checklist

Follow these steps in order to move the mainnet admin from a single keypair to a 2-of-3
multisig. Do not skip the on-chain verification step.

- [ ] **1. Create the multisig account.** Create a dedicated admin Stellar account and add
  signers B and C (weights `1` each), then set `low/medium/high` thresholds to `2` as shown
  in the Setup section above. Confirm the master weight is `1` so no single key can act alone.
- [ ] **2. Verify the multisig config.** Run `stellar account show --account <ADMIN_ACCOUNT>`
  and confirm three signers with weight `1` and thresholds `low: 2, medium: 2, high: 2`.
- [ ] **3. Transfer admin.** Point the contract admin at the multisig account. If the contract
  is not yet initialized, pass the multisig address directly to `initialize --admin`. If it is
  already initialized with a single-key admin, use the contract's admin-transfer path (or
  re-initialize per the upgrade procedure) so the new admin is the multisig address.
- [ ] **4. Verify the transfer on-chain.** Query the contract's stored admin and confirm it
  equals the multisig account address:

  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke --id <STREAM_ID> --network mainnet \
    -- get_admin
  ```

  The returned address must match `<ADMIN_ACCOUNT>` (or `<MULTISIG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` for the
  contract-based approach).
- [ ] **5. Exercise an admin call through multisig.** Perform a low-risk admin operation
  (e.g., a no-op `set_min_deposit` to its current value) using the 2-of-3 signing flow and
  confirm it succeeds only with two signatures.
- [ ] **6. Record the configuration.** Update `docs/security/threat-model.md` (RR-01) with the
  actual signer set and threshold used.

---

## Operations Runbook: Admin Calls

All mainnet admin calls **must** go through the multisig signing flow. A single signer must
never be able to submit an admin transaction.

1. **Prepare.** The proposer builds the admin transaction with `--build-only` using their own
   key as `--source` (see "Signing admin transactions" above).
2. **Collect signatures.** At least **2 of 3** signers must sign the XDR. Distribute the
   unsigned XDR to the co-signers out-of-band; each signs with `stellar tx sign`.
3. **Verify threshold.** Before submitting, confirm the transaction carries at least two valid
   signatures from distinct signers. A transaction with fewer than two signatures will fail
   the account threshold and must not be submitted.
4. **Submit.** Submit the fully-signed XDR with `stellar tx submit`.
5. **Confirm.** Verify the operation took effect on-chain (e.g., re-query contract state) and
   record the transaction hash in the operations log.

Applies to every admin entry point: `pause_contract`, `unpause_contract`, `set_min_deposit`,
and any contract upgrade / WASM replacement.

## Testnet Verification

Admin operations must be verified on testnet before mainnet deployment. To demonstrate that
admin operations work via multisig auth in the Soroban test environment:

### In `contracts/stream/src/test.rs`

```rust
#[test]
fn test_admin_operations_via_multisig() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    // Simulate a multisig: the admin account address is controlled by two signers.
    // In Soroban's test env, mock_all_auths() approves all auth checks,
    // which is equivalent to verifying that the auth path is correctly wired.
    // Real multisig threshold testing requires the Stellar integration test harness.

    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, crate::StreamContract);
    let client = crate::StreamContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    client.initialize(&admin);

    // Confirm admin operations require admin auth
    let auths = env.auths();
    assert!(auths.iter().any(|(addr, _)| *addr == admin));
}
```

On testnet, run the full onboarding checklist above against a testnet multisig account and
confirm that admin calls succeed with 2 signatures and fail with 1 before promoting to mainnet.

---

## Deploy Script Update

`scripts/init-testnet.sh` now accepts a `STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS` that can be a multisig account:

```bash
# To use a multisig admin, set the account address (not a secret key):
export STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS="G..."   # multisig account public key
export STELLAR_SOURCE_ACCOUNT="G..." # deployer key that funds the init transaction
```

The `STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS` is passed directly to `initialize --admin`, so any Stellar account
address (including multisig accounts) is valid.

---

## Threat Model Reference

This setup mitigates **RR-01** (admin key compromise) from `docs/security/threat-model.md`.
Once a 2-of-3 multisig admin is in place, an attacker must compromise at least 2 of the 3
signing keys to gain admin control — a significantly higher bar than a single keypair.

Update the threat model after mainnet deployment to reflect the actual signer configuration
and threshold used.
